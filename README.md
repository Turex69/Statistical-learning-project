# Statistical-learning-project
Report for Statistical Learning course of my Master's degree in Data science for managament using RStudio.
Given the specific dataset, I performed an Exploratory data analysis, and then I moved on the real purpose of the course, that was use some machine learning/deep learning approach to predict in the test dataset the target variable. In particular, I used logistic regression, random forest and neural network. Based on the accuracy, the best results were achieved by neural network with an accuracy of the 99%.
